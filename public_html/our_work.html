                Our Team of Volunteers from the Save Africa Foundation come 
                together from the USA, Canada, Germany and Ghana to bring 
                much needed health care to the most vulnerable populations 
                in Ghana. Each year four programs are run during our outreach 
                mission: medical, surgical, leadership development, and 
                financial/equipment support. Aside from our annual programs, 
                our academic sponsorship initiative runs continuously 
                throughout the year.

                    Save Africa foundation is a registered Non Government 
                organization with operations in Ghana, West Africa and South Africa.
                It was founded in 2019 by Dr. Leolen Nair of Dundee, South Africa.<br><br>
                During his numerous visits to Ghana, Dr. Leolen identified that 
                there was an urgent need to provide some critical and necessary 
                healthcare services to some of the poorest people within the 
                regions. In the rural areas of Ghana, lack of resources coupled 
                with poverty are barriers to receiving quality healthcare. 
                Having noted this need, he made it his personal mission to help 
                change the lives of the underprivileged by helping them gain 
                free access to healthcare and independence
