                        <h2>Our History</h2>
                        <p>Save Africa foundation is a registered Non Government 
                organization with operations in Ghana, West Africa and South Africa.
                It was founded in 2019 by Dr. Leolen Nair of Dundee, South Africa.<br><br>
                During his numerous visits to Ghana, Dr. Leolen identified that 
                there was an urgent need to provide some critical and necessary 
                healthcare services to some of the poorest people within the 
                regions. In the rural areas of Ghana, lack of resources coupled 
                with poverty are barriers to receiving quality healthcare. 
                Having noted this need, he made it his personal mission to help 
                change the lives of the underprivileged by helping them gain 
                free access to healthcare and independence</p>

                        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                        <p>The aim of the African Vision Foundation is to transfer
                            sustainable life skills, environmental education and
                            birding conservation knowledge - and to provide tools
                            and equipment - to communities inside or on the borders
                            of national parks, nature reserves, conservancies, 
                            wildernesses and remote areas in southern Africa. 
                            The skills transfer and tools should improve the 
                            quality of life in these communities by furthering both
                            child and adult vitality.<br><br>
                            This initiative is about
                            incorporating a vision of a sustainable future into
                            the culture and everyday living of communities. 
                            Long-term relationships are formed in order to find
                            practical solutions to their needs and challenges to
                            ensure hope for the future. The programme provides
                            significant social and conservation responsibility
                            offsets for donors and sponsors.</p>
